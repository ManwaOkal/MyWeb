                    <h2>Join us!</h2>
                      <p>We have worked to create a learning atmosphere where anyone with the desire to learn can join us since the organization's foundation. However, due to financial and logistical limitations, we haven't expanded past a single classroom and haven't had the chance to fulfill further goals. Despite the difficulties we are having, we have developed a virtual classroom that has increased our capacity thanks to a variety of online learning tools. Therefore, you are welcome to come to our office in Kisii whether you want to join us out of love or you want a thorough introduction to programming. Additionally, we have created a close-knit community where everyone is eager to assist one another, so you will receive the best care possible. We can't wait to have you under our tutelage, bring your good vibes and let's code.<p>

          <p>In order to alleviate the  rising cases of insecurity caused by unemployment, the organization was founded to bridge the gap between local youths and the programming world. As the sole tutor, I limited the number of students to 5, whom I guided through CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript for web development. I also went over Twitter bootstrap, Hosting projects on GitHub and SEO with them.</p>
