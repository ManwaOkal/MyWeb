              <p>Driven by our slogan, <em>&quot;Tech meets creativity,&quot;</em> we have established a reputation for being more than just full-stack developers. Our innovative problem-solving strategy necessitates that we first establish a strong working relationship with our client(s). We take the business as our own and devote ourselves to producing bespoke user-friendly programs  and websites. From its inception in 2021, Tech logics has successfully designed and delivered five VBA-based apps to schools and hotels around the country. We've also delivered a CSV-based Python application to a local phone shop that was having trouble keeping track of inventory.
              Our services also go beyond software development. We offer train local youngsters at no fee on how to develop websites and databases in order to equip them with marketable programming skills. With us, they study HTML, CSS, and Javascript for constructing responsive websites. We also train local farmers on basic computer packages to facilitate their day to day activities.
              Remember, you are not too young or too old to start programing! Where there is a will there is definetly a way.

               <p><em>I had a lot of questions when I first started the program, including whether I would be able to handle the commitment and how much work there would be. Working with Carey, however, was quite beneficial. He mentored me and guided me through every last detail of programming. Carey was a friend I could always come to when I was having problems, in addition to being a wonderful teacher. That, in my opinion, is what distinguishes Tech logics.</em></p>

               <p><em>Tech logics arrived at a point in my life when I was quite uncertain. I had just finished high school, and the grade I received did not allow me to continue on to university. The majority of people I approached seeking help dismissed me, but Tech logics accepted me. Now, every time I sit down to create a website, I am reminded of how one person can change the lives of many by standing by what he believes in all the way to the end. I appreciate you, Carey.</em></p>

             <p><em>The government's inability to adequately address Kenya's unemployment crisis is one of the country's worst failings. After finishing college, most young people, including myself, started looking for jobs. To our dismay, there were simply no jobs available. Thanks to tech logics I can now support those around me and make a life as a freelancer thanks to. This is thereward for dreaming to dream. To anyone out there interested, tech logics is here for you! </em></p>

               <p> <em><strong>"Insanity does not preclude substance," Van Goh.</strong> When Carey came up with this idea of creating a space where anyone interested in coding can walk in and get tutored at little to no cost, most people considered it a far fetched dream that wasn't plausible. It would be correct to say that some considered him insane. We all saw him getting challenged daily by nay-sayers but he never gave up on us. That is the beloved friend-turned-instructor we all love. </em></p>
