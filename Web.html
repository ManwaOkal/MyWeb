  <div class="container-fluid" id="Main-content"><h1 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">Web Development</h1>
     
     <p>Web development skills are becoming a necessity in today's world. Every startup/ business requires a website to reach a wider pool of customers. The problem is that there isn't enough web developers supply to match demand, so economics comes in and prices skyrocket. To avoid falling victim to this trend, you need to have these skills.</p>
      <p>Our students at Tech Logics are taught three fundamental languages: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Javascript For Web Developers. Once students have learned the fundamental syntax, we incorporate the Twitter Bootstrap framework to construct Responsive websites.</p>
      <p><h1 style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 19px; font-family: monospace;  text-decoration: none;">Skills Gained as a Web Developer</h1>
If you hope to become a web developer, you must understand HTML and CSS. HTML is the most used markup language across the web, and web developers use it to create web pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the website. It's responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's design. Whereas HTML lays the foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.

<h1 style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 19px; font-family: monospace; text-decoration: none;">Responsive Design Skills</h1>
If you work as a web developer, it's important to understand how responsive design works. Because many people view webpages both online and on their mobile devices, the websites you create need to adapt to the changing screen sizes. If your website isn't responsive, this means it won't be compatible with either the desktop site or the mobile site. In other words, it won't function or show up properly on either of these platforms. Your ability to create a responsive design can also impact the number of visitors a website gets since most people are deterred from a website when it's not displaying properly.

<h1 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;font-size: 19px; font-family: monospace; text-decoration: none;">Javascript Skills</h1>
You'll also need to understand JavaScript as a web developer. JavaScript is a high-level programming language that implements complex features onto a website. This involves things like moving elements, search bars, videos or interactive maps on a webpage. In knowing JavaScript, you'll be able to meet higher expectations from your clients in the web development process. Using these skills, you'll be able to reel in more webpage viewers, as well, since the majority of people tend to prefer interactive web pages that grab their attention. Special features go a long way in engaging viewers, and your job as a web developer plays a large role in seeing them come to fruition on a digital screen.

<h1 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;font-size: 19px; font-family: monospace;">Search Engine Optimization Skills</h1>
As a web developer, you must know all about search engine optimization. This is because website traffic is becoming more and more important to companies. If a website has good SEO, it'll attract a greater number of webpage visitors by showing up high enough in search engine result pages. Because more and more companies are looking to have good SEO, it's an important skill to have as a web developer.<br>
