# About Carey

## Education
I began my elementary education at Hannington Academy in Oyugis before moving on to Darajambili Primary school in Kenya's Kisii county in 2008 for my primary education. I completed my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in 2016 as the valedictorian. This earned me a place at the highly selective Chavakali National School.

Throughout my high school career, I worked as a peer counsellor before being promoted to the position of guidance and counseling captain on my 12th grade, putting me in charge of the operations of 200 peer counsellors. I was also consistently ranked as the top performing student in Computer Science which made me more hungry to pursue a career in this field.

I sat for my Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam in 2021 and received an overall grade of A-, earning me a government scholarship to Baraton University to study Software Engineering. I declined the offer and instead concentrated on applying to Cornell University the EducationUSA scholars program.

After a rigorous application process, I was accepted to **Cornell Universityâ€™s College of agriculture and Life Sciences as an Information Science Major** during early decision making me the first boy in my community to obtain college education.
