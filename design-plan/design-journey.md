# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

## Audience & Goals (Milestone 1)

Using what you learned from studying the example websites, identify your website's audience and their goals.

### Audience (Milestone 1)

> Briefly explain who the intended audience is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site's topic.

My site's audience will mainly be anyone who has an ardent desire to learn how to code but do not know where to start from and any potential future employer in need of a web developer. I will also be targetting donors to help me in my course of bringing programming skills to the door of every Kenyan home.

### Audience Goals (Milestone 1)

> Why would your audience visit your site?
> Identify at least 3 goals that your users have for visiting your website.

1. To get more information on how to build websites.

2. To get to know me as a person.

3. To get context of what I do and who I have manged to reach out to.
4. To see my work before deciding when making a decision on whether to hire me or not.

## Content Planning (Milestone 1)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 1)

> List **all** the content you plan to include your personal website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Text; a description of my work and what I hope to achieve and my contact details.
- links; Links to programming resources.
- Photos; For aesthetic purposes.

### Content Justification (Milestone 1)

> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

- For the longest time, most kenyans have grown up believing that programming is a Utopian concept that is only limited to the high and mighty in society. It is therefore important to deconstruct this myth by providing all the resources at no fee on this website whilst teaching rather novel concepts in simplified ways. Also by sharing my personal education journey, my story will be an inspiration to anyone who thinks that they cannot overcome their problems and scale the heights of academia.

### Home Page Content (Milestone 1)

> What is the content that your users would expect when visiting your site for the first time.
>
> Briefly identify what content you will include on the homepage and why this content should be the first thing your target audience sees when they visit your site.

Homepage content: My education journey,interests and my work experience.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

For milestone 2, you will design the information architecture for all the pages your website.

You may change your homepage content based on your card sorting. If you do change the homepage content, don't update it above, just include the new plan in the section below (Content Organization).

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![Iteration1](Images/../../Images/IMG_1039.jpg)
For the iteration above, I chose to group my education,work experience inspiration and articles I have been featured on since they all talk about me directly. The location and contact form are grouped together so that incase one gets lost on the way, they easily have a access to someone they can contact or submit their information to. The links to resources, donations form and sponsors' logos are together since they all touch to the finacial aspect of the startup. The success stories, learning outcomes and complete projects are grouped together since they all talk of our achievements as a startup.

![Iteration2](../Images//IMG_1040.jpg)
For the iteration above, I grouped my education, location of the startup and the inspiration behind the startup to create a storyline i.e; How I got my education, how I actualized my dreams and finally where I drew my inspiration to do all this. For the middle set of cards, I put together all the cards that touch on the impact of the work we do at the startup and if one is inspired or wants more information, there is a contact form. I finally grouped donations, sponsors, and intersts with complete projects so as to inspire someone to donate after seeing the good work we are doing.
### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

I will use the second iteraion.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

I strongly believe it has appropriately combined all related fields and organizing the pages based on the iteration will make the site very esay to navigate. It also allows me to add related images per webpage thus the user will feel conected to the content.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Success stories
- Join Us

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

- For Home, the user will automatically know that that's where the introduction to what the website is all about and the best place to start their navigation on the website. Once they have an idea of what the site is about, the Success stories page will make sense since they will want to know what the impact of what we do. Lastly the 'Join Us' page name will make sense since the page's content is geared towards providing all the info one needs to know before commiting to join us.

## Visual Themes (Milestone 3)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

### Theme Ideas (Milestone 3)

> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.

- I'm thinking about employing a royal blue background for the background to evoke an exuberant vibe. A serene yet slightly brilliant color will do a great job of communicating a message of hope to everybody who visits the website. Along with yellow text, the royal blue background will convey positive vibes.
- As an alternative, I could use a dark background image for the body and a gray background with white writing in place of royal blue for some text-heavy parts. This "calming color combination" will help me achieve my objective of making a pleasant space. To draw the reader's attention to the navigation bar, I'll use black font against a white background.

### Final Theme (Milestone 3)

> Which theme did you select as your final theme? Why?

- I'll go with choice number two (Dark, white and gray). The audience will feel calmer as a result of the contrast between the black, white, and gray, which also sets the mood for the site's content. Because it is more adaptable and simple to combine with text, I chose this over the royal blue. The theme is also calming.


### Theme Rationale (Milestone 3)

> Discuss your final theme design: how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?

- My intention is to build a less formal and more welcoming website so that anyone who visits would enjoy reading its contents. Black, gray and white colors are definetly the best best to achieving this.

> Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions were you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?

- Happiness
- Inspirational
- Calming

## Layout & Composition (Final Submission)

### Home Page Layout (Final Submission)

> Include several sketches of possible layout ideas for the home page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea.
> Show your design process.
> **Use the example websites above as inspiration for your site's design.**

  ![First Sketch](/design-plan/IMG-1227.jpg)

- With the layout above, I can capture snippets of what is contained in my entire site. The clicable images are meant to improve the general aesthetic of the site.

 ![Second Sketch](/design-plan/IMG-1228.jpg)

- With this sketch I intend to user less text and more images on the home page but the images will be links to other sections of the website.

 ![Second Sketch](/design-plan/IMG-1229.jpg)

- For this sketch, I focused on the text heavy part of the websites. It captures all the main sites contents whilst making the site easy to navihate and easy to find content.

### Final Site Design (Final Submission)

> Include a sketch of the final layout for each page in your site.
> Provide an explanation below each sketch.

![Page 1 sketch](/design-plan/IMG-1235.jpg)

- The sketch above gives an introduction to my site and is meant to capture the attention of my audience by giving them insight into who I am.

![Page 2 sketch](/design-plan/IMG-1236.jpg)

- This page is soley dedicated to technology logics, what we have done and what our alum have to say.

![Page 3 sketch](/design-plan/IMG-1237.jpg)

- This sketch is aimed at getting to capture the commonly asked questions and how to join technlogy logics.

### Static Website Design Check (Final Submission)

> We're building a static website without interactivity.
> **No part of your website may dynamically change.**
> Examples of dynamic behavior are dropdown menus, hamburger menus, popups, modals/lightboxes, image carousels, etc.
>dfd
> Audit your design and check that you aren't relying on any dynamic features.

- The contents of the website are displayed as fixed contentsas I coded them in HTML. They are not adapting to the browser width.

## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs a few paragraphs (1-2). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during the design process and how you addressed them.

**All images must be visible in "Markdown: Open Preview" for credit!**

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Audience (Final Submission)

> A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.

- Anyone interested in learning how to program but unsure of where to begin is my intended audience. I have an entire webpage dedicated to this on my website, where the contents are. Additionally, anyone curious about Carey and his accomplishments will undoubtedly find the website to be a useful resource. Finally, my audience will also include future employers. All the essential details they could require to decide whether or not to hire me are on the first page.

### Design Goals (Final Submission)

> An explanation of the design goals for that audience, based on your earlier rationales.

- My first design objective for the audience is to incorporate the website's very text-heavy material without compromising the website's appeal or usability. This, however, presented a significant issue because I continuously encountered CSS issues. In order to handle this, I choose to create the website in stages, starting with the navigation bar, core content, and flexible paragraphs. This relatively simplified approach helped fit all the content into the site whilst maintaining the ease of navigation.
- In addition, I didn't want the aesthetics of the site's content to make the audience bored to death. I used a lot of "calming" hues, such subtly dull gray, white, and black, in a bid to make people feel calm. Rather than opting for 'shouting' colors, to convey positive vibes as I had earlier intending, I went for calmness due to the text heavy aspect of the site.
- Lastly, I wanted the audience to follow the story of tech logics from start to finish. I also wanted it not to be just a story; but a story of hope and breaking the glass ceiling. I therefore arranged my site's content in pages that complemented each other thus making it eier for the audience to follow the story of tech logics.

### Content Organization & Navigation (Final Submission)

> An explanation of how the final content organization and navigation met your goals and why it's appropriate for your audience.

-I organized my site's pages into 3 pages, all with the same layout. All these pages have titles similar to the link on the navigation bar leading to them which makes the site very easy to navigate. All pages have accompanying images next to the main paragraph that blend in perfectly with the length of the paragraphs, contributing to the site's soft boxy design. Finally, each webpage is split into three sections: the navigation bar, the main paragraph, and four smaller paragraphs. This design allows the text contents to be fit without making the page too long to navigate.

### Visual Design (Final Submission)

> An explanation of how the final design met your goals and why it's appropriate for your audience.

- My final design makes extensive use of soft edges as opposed to sharp edges. I opted for this to make the site more welcoming and calming. To add on to this, I chose to use a black background, white text and a gray background for the paragraphs. This was meant add on to the visual appel that I wanted my site to have, a more soothing kind of vibe.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)

> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

- I entered the class as a novice, knowing very little about CSS, let alone HTML. It's been fascinating to use flex boxes instead of floating elements, as I used to. I've also learned a lot about acceptable web development practices that I had previously overlooked. I am amazed by the amount of progress I have made in the past weeks and I can't wait to learn more.
