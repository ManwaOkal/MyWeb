# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

## Audience & Goals (Milestone 1)

Using what you learned from studying the example websites, identify your website's audience and their goals.

### Audience (Milestone 1)

> Briefly explain who the intended audience is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site's topic.

My site's audience will mainly be anyone who has an ardent desire to learn how to code but do not know where to start from and any potential future employer in need of a web developer. I will also be targetting donors to help me in my course of bringing programming skills to the door of every Kenyan home.

### Audience Goals (Milestone 1)

> Why would your audience visit your site?
> Identify at least 3 goals that your users have for visiting your website.

1. To get more information on how to build websites.

2. To get to know me as a person.

3. To get context of what I do and who I have manged to reach out to.
4. To see my work before deciding when making a decision on whether to hire me or not.

## Content Planning (Milestone 1)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 1)

> List **all** the content you plan to include your personal website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Text; a description of my work and what I hope to achieve and my contact details.
- links; Links to programming resources.
- Photos; For aesthetic purposes.

### Content Justification (Milestone 1)

> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

- For the longest time, most kenyans have grown up believing that programming is a Utopian concept that is only limited to the high and mighty in society. It is therefore important to deconstruct this myth by providing all the resources at no fee on this website whilst teaching rather novel concepts in simplified ways. Also by sharing my personal education journey, my story will be an inspiration to anyone who thinks that they cannot overcome their problems and scale the heights of academia.

### Home Page Content (Milestone 1)

> What is the content that your users would expect when visiting your site for the first time.
>
> Briefly identify what content you will include on the homepage and why this content should be the first thing your target audience sees when they visit your site.

Homepage content: My education journey,interests and my work experience.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

For milestone 2, you will design the information architecture for all the pages your website.

You may change your homepage content based on your card sorting. If you do change the homepage content, don't update it above, just include the new plan in the section below (Content Organization).

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![Iteration1](Images/../../Images/IMG_1039.jpg)
For the iteration above, I chose to group my education,work experience inspiration and articles I have been featured on since they all talk about me directly. The location and contact form are grouped together so that incase one gets lost on the way, they easily have a access to someone they can contact or submit their information to. The links to resources, donations form and sponsors' logos are together since they all touch to the finacial aspect of the startup. The success stories, learning outcomes and complete projects are grouped together since they all talk of our achievements as a startup.

![Iteration2](../Images//IMG_1040.jpg)
For the iteration above, I grouped my education, location of the startup and the inspiration behind the startup to create a storyline i.e; How I got my education, how I actualized my dreams and finally where I drew my inspiration to do all this. For the middle set of cards, I put together all the cards that touch on the impact of the work we do at the startup and if one is inspired or wants more information, there is a contact form. I finally grouped donations, sponsors, and intersts with complete projects so as to inspire someone to donate after seeing the good work we are doing.
### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

I will use the second iteraion.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

I strongly believe it has appropriately combined all related fields and organizing the pages based on the iteration will make the site very esay to navigate. It also allows me to add related images per webpage thus the user will feel conected to the content.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Success stories
- Join Us
> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

For Home, the user will automatically know that that's where the introduction to what the website is all about and the best place to start their navigation on the website. Once they have an idea of what the site is about, the Success stories page will make sense since they will want to know what the impact of what we do. Lastly the 'Join Us' page name will make sense since the page's content is geared towards accepting donations.

## Visual Themes (Milestone 3)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

### Theme Ideas (Milestone 3)

> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.

- I'm thinking about employing a royal blue background for the background to evoke an exuberant vibe. A serene yet slightly brilliant color will do a great job of communicating a message of hope to everybody who visits the website. Along with yellow text, the royal blue background will convey positive vibes.
- As an alternative, I could use a dark background image for the body and a gray background with white writing in place of royal blue for some text-heavy parts. This "calming color combination" will help me achieve my objective of making a pleasant space. To draw the reader's attention to the navigation bar, I'll use black font against a white background.

### Final Theme (Milestone 3)

> Which theme did you select as your final theme? Why?

- I'll go with choice number two (Dark, white and gray). The audience will feel calmer as a result of the contrast between the black, white, and gray, which also sets the mood for the site's content. Because it is more adaptable and simple to combine with text, I chose this over the royal blue. The theme is also calming.


### Theme Rationale (Milestone 3)

> Discuss your final theme design: how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?

- My intention is to build a less formal and more welcoming website so that anyone who visits would enjoy reading its contents. Black, gray and white colors are definetly the best best to achieving this.

> Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions were you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?

- Happiness
- Inspirational
- Calming

## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs a few paragraphs (1-2). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during the design process and how you addressed them.

**All images must be visible in "Markdown: Open Preview" for credit!**

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.
