                    <p> Hi there! My name is Carey and my super power is smiling! I began my elementary education at Hannington Academy in Oyugis before moving on to Darajambili Primary school in Kenya's Kisii county in 2008 for my primary education. I completed my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in 2016 as the valedictorian. This earned me a place at the highly selective Chavakali National School.
                    Throughout my high school career, I worked as a peer counsellor before being promoted to the position of guidance and counseling captain on my 12th grade, putting me in charge of the operations of 200 peer counsellors. I was also consistently ranked as the top performing student in Computer Science which made me more hungry to pursue a career in this field.
                    I sat for my Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam in 2021 and received an overall grade of A-, earning me a government scholarship to Baraton University to study Software Engineering. I declined the offer and instead concentrated on applying to Cornell University through the EducationUSA scholars program.
                    After a rigorous application process, I was accepted to <strong>Cornell Universityâ€™s College of agriculture and Life Sciences as an Information Science Major</strong> during early decision making me the first boy in my community to obtain college education.</p>

           <p>In order to alleviate the  rising cases of insecurity caused by unemployment, the organization was founded to bridge the gap between local youths and the programming world. As the sole tutor, I limited the number of students to 5, whom I guided through CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript for web development. I also went over Twitter bootstrap, Hosting projects on GitHub and SEO with them.</p>
