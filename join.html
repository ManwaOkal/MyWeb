                      <p>We have worked to create a learning atmosphere where anyone with the desire to learn can join us since the organization's foundation. However, due to financial and logistical limitations, we haven't expanded past a single classroom and haven't had the chance to fulfill further goals. Despite the difficulties we are having, we have developed a virtual classroom that has increased our capacity thanks to a variety of online learning tools. Therefore, you are welcome to come to our office in Kisii whether you want to join us out of love or you want a thorough introduction to programming. Additionally, we have created a close-knit community where everyone is eager to assist one another, so you will receive the best care possible. We can't wait to have you under our tutelage, bring your good vibes and let's code.<p>

       <div class="Interest-content">
         <h2>How Long does the program take?</h2>
           <p> Our bootcamps for web development normally last three to four months and teach all the skills required to be hired as a web developer. However, depending on how much time you invest in your studies, learning web development from us can take anywhere from one month to 3 months. For the farmers, we normally train them over a period of 2 weeks.</p>

         <h2>Is Coding Fun?</h2>
           <p>Enthralling is the word! If you are the kind of person who enjoys sitting and solving problems, coding will definitely be fun. I have projects that I just did out of pure fun. If you are also a perfectionist like I am, most often than not you will have a hard time sleeping where there is a bug you are having a hard time fixing. At times you will get 'revelations' in your sleep on how to fix a bug. It's definitely fun.</p>

       <div class="Interest-content">
         <h2>Do I have to pay anything?</h2>
           <p>The program's affordability was the most important element we took into account when determining what would prevent us from solving the unemployment crisis in our beloved nation. We made the program cost-free to address this. In addition, there is no requirement that the local farmers who come to receive computer training make any payment.</p>
